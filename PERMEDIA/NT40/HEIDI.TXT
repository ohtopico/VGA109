Version 1.31

To install the latest version of your GLINT Heidi driver, locate
your 3DStudio Max directory on your hard drive and then enter
the Drivers sub-directory. Rename the file in there 'wglint.hdi'
to 'wglint.bak'. Then copy the new 'wglint.hdi' from this floppy,
to the Drivers directory.

You can now run 3DStudio Max, and the new driver will be used.

If using Permedia or Permedia NT cards, the best performance can
be achieved through running in 32768 color mode.

If using GLINT 500TX based cards, the best performance can be
achieved by running in TrueColor.
