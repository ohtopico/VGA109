Special notes for Windows 95 users
=================================
Due to the plug & play feature of Windows 95, if it is the first time 
you install a new hareware card and then launch Windows 95, Windows 
will find a new device is installed and ask you to insert the driver diskette. 
In this case, please insert the Setup CD into CD-ROM. 
(Assume your CD-ROM drive is on drive D:,if it is not, change D: to other 
drive letter.) Then input the driver source as 

    D:\Voodoo    (if you install a HELIOS 3D-Voodoo card) 	  or
    D:\Voodoo2   (if you install a HELIOS 3D-Voodoo2 card) 	  or
    D:\Rush      (if you install a HELIOS 3D-Voodoo Rush card)
