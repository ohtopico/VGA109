NOTES:

Users that have a S3 968/868 based 2D video card may 
experience system lock ups or erratic behavior once 
DirectX is installed on their system. 

The S3 968 and 868 have a chipset flaw which prior to 
DirectX shipping wasn't noticeable. DirectX uses a 
mapped memory driver for S3 based cards, whereas the 
Windows 95 default drivers for S3 cards do not use 
Mapped Memory.

To fix this problem, please see the Readme file under
\Voodoo2\S3fix directory on this CD.
