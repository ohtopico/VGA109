What's in the distribution?
=======================================================================
This distribution contains the S3 968/868 remap kit for Voodoo Graphics
and Voodoo2 Based 3D Accelerators.  This kit will remap a Voodoo 
Graphics or Voodoo2 board to a memory range that will not conflict with
a video board using S3 968/868 video chips.  Without this kit it is 
possible that with certain system BIOS's a hang can occur when running
a 3D application.

This software will function with all Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 Based
3D Accelerator reference boards.
