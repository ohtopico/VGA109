TITLE: "S3 VGA Dos Utilities Installation"

OVERWRITEFILE:yes

BEGINFIRSTSCREEN

  You have chosen to install S3 VGA Dos Utilities.  

  The S3 VGA Dos Utilities include the following programs:

  1. S3REFRSH.EXE 
       Run this program to configure the display adapter for  
       the highest vertical refresh rates supported by your
       monitor. Higher refresh rate is less likely to cause
       eye fatigue due to screen flicker. The configuration
       settings you select can optionally be written to your
       AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that the display adapter will be
       set according to your selections each time you start
       the system.

  2. SMODE.EXE
       Run this program whenever you need to configure the S3  
       for a specific video mode.
