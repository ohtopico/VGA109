				CANCUN DEMO
				-------------

To run the demo, you will need either Windows NT or Windows 95.

To install the Cancun demo, just pkunzip into a directory, and create
an icon to launch (or Run from the program manager) CANCUN.EXE.

When you click on the icon to run the demo, the following keys are active :

Left arrow rotates camera left around the character
Right arrow rotates camera right around the character
Up arrow moves camera toward the character
Down arrow moves camera away from the character
PgUp raises the camera
PgDn lowers the camera
Ins rolls the camera left
Del rolls the camera right

If you select the Free Camera option, the camera drops to the ground, and
you can walk around the world in a first person POV.

Left arrow rotates left
Right arrow rotates right
Up arrow moves forward
Down arrow moves backward
Shift key speeds up player's movement
PgUp looks up
PgDn looks down
Ins rolls left
Del rolls right

To remove the character from the environment to speed rendering, select
the no character menu option. To view more characters, use the 2-16 character
menu options.  To see the frame rate and polygon count for the scene, use
the frame rate menu option.

If you select the Low Res menu option, the image is rendered at half the
display resolution both vertically and horizontally, and stretched to the
display resolution.

If you select the Auto-Low Res menu option, the display automatically
switches to a lower resolution to speed up movement when the camera
moves.  The effect works best in Free Camera mode.

The display window defaults to 320x200, but you can resize it arbitrarily,
or use the 320x200 or 640x400 menu options.

If you have Direct Draw driver for your display card, you can select the
Direct Draw menu option to see the demo in full screen 640x480.  For optimum
performance, make sure you have the latest driver for your display card.
Hit Esc to exit Direct Draw mode.

This is a preliminary demo, demonstrating the following features :
1. Sloping walls.
Polygons in the environment can be placed in any orientation.
This allows for ramps, peaked roofs, pyramids, whatever, all
with perspective correct texturing.
2. Multiple levels.
Polygons in the environment can be placed over each other vertically,
so multiple floors of a building can be represented, and elements like
bridges can be created.
3. Full 6-degrees of freedom in camera movement.
Freedom of movement in the "roll" direction has been added.
This is rotation around an axis perpendicular to the viewing plane.
4. Mip-mapping.
Textures seen in the distance use a series of smaller bitmaps,
automatically generated by the program.  This eliminates the
"texture crawl" artifacting on distant walls.
5. 3D textured, animated models for enemies.
Enemies and other characters are texture mapped, animated models,
created from individual body parts, whose movements are stored as
a series of joint movements.  The advantage of this is that complex
motions can be achieved, and many different sprite types used, without
excessive memory requirements.  The characters can also be shown carrying
different weapons or objects easily.
6. Lighting effects.
Gouraud shading is used to provide dynamic (changing) lighting effects
across walls and floors.
7. Support for Direct Draw to view 640 by 480 full screen.
