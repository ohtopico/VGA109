GERMANY

Limited Warranty

To the extent required by local law, the following provisions shall apply to you.  If not so required, the provisions set forth for Any Other Country above shall apply:

Limited Warranty.  Chromatic and Manufacturer warrant for six (6) months from the date of delivery to you that the enclosed diskette medium upon which the Software is recorded shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and condition, and that the Software shall perform substantially as described in the documentation.  If it should become apparent that the Software is defective, you agree to notify Chromatic or Manufacturer within two weeks and in no event later than the end of the six month period.  Upon receipt of the notification, Manufacturer or Chromatic will supply you with a replacement copy of the Software.  If that should not cure the defect, you may resort to your statutory rights and either request repayment of the license fee against return of the Software, or request a reasonable reduction of the license fee.

Limitation on Liability.  Chromatic, Manufacturer, their employees, and subcontractors shall be liable for damages, whether based on this or any other agreement, tort, or any other legal theory, only if such damage has been caused (i) either by gross negligence or intent, or the lack of a certain property of the Software which had been expressly guaranteed by Manufacturer or Chromatic; or (ii) Chromatic’s or Manufacturer’s failure to comply with an essential obligation under this Agreement with at least some degree of negligence, or (iii) by a violation of third party rights protected statute or applicable product liability laws.  Such liability shall not cover any damage which Chromatic or Manufacturer were unable to foresee when concluding this Agreement, except if the liability is based on at least gross negligence of an officer of Chromatic or Manufacturer or on intent.  Chromatic’s 
or Manufacturer’s liability shall in no event cover damages caused by the loss of data, especially if such loss could have been avoided by regular back-up, or any damages caused by using the Software which could have been prevented by examination of the work products of the Software at regular intervals.

To the extent that the respective statutory limitation period does not expire earlier and expect for claims based on tort, any claims for damages shall be barred after two years from the delivery of the Software.  Chromatic’s and Manufacturer’s liability under or in connection with this Agreement, including in particular its liability for any defects in the Software, shall be strictly limited to the foregoing provisions.

Applicability.  The provisions of this Agreement shall apply whether or not the Software is protected under German copyright law.
