   move there.

   Hit F7 to bring up the map point at a 
   position on the map and you will command
   your ship to move there.

Q: There seems to be a lot of camera views.  What
   are they?  Why do you have so many camera views?
A: Knowing where you are and what's happening around
   you is the key to victory.  With that in mind
   all of the camera view provided are for your
   surveying of the 3D space environment.  Here
   is a listing of Camera view and their purpose:

   (F5) My Ship Navigation First person:
   Think of your self on the deck of the ship looking
   out the windows of the ship into space.  The green
   cross hairs are magnification marks to help you
   gauge magnification factor.  The camera follows the
   movement of the mouse.  If you are in a fighter,
   you will always move in the direction of where
   you are looking.  If you are on a ship, the
   direction of motion is not in the same direction 
   as the ship.  In this view, you can pick into
   the 3D window, and you will command your ship
   to move in that direction.  You use this 
   view for precise navigation of your ship.
   If your ship has a turret, if you activate it, 
   you see from the eyes of your turret.
 
   (F4) My Ship External Camera Follow: 
   The camera follows your ship.  You can pan
   and zoom the camera to examine your
   surrounding space.  Use this view
   defend against missile attacks and
   fighters.

   (F6) Target Ship External Camera Follow: 
   The camera follows your current selected
   target ship.  Use this view to see what
   your enemy is doing.  He may be far away.

   (F7) Map View:
   Top view of the space.  Use this view
   for long range moves including hyper jumps.

   (F3) Middle View:
   This view puts the center of the screen to
   be the middle distance between you and a target.
   Use this view when you always want to know 
   where you are relative to one target.

   (F2) Fix View:
   The camera is stationary externally in
   space.  The camera will pan if your ship 
   moves out of the viewing space.

Q: How do I shoot as the ship?
A: Select the Turret weapon system (Space bar) and
   you will be put in to the Turret
   Camera View (inside the turret).  
   Point at the target
   and press the left mouse button to shoot.
   Release Button To Stop Shooting.

   There are other weapon systems on your
   ship you should consider.  Have a try at
   it.

Q: When I’m in turret mode, I can only
   shoot at stuff, how do I go back 
   to steering the ship?
A: Hit the space bar, or click on the
   Turret cannon to switch back to
   navigation mode.

Q:  How do I take control of a fighter.
A:  On the lower right corner of the
    screen is the Your Fleet window.
    the 6'th button is fighter button.
    Unlike capital ships which have
    their own icons, all fighters are
    lumped into the 6'th button.  Pressing
    that will give you the next fighter.
    If you continually press it, you
    will toggle through the list
    of available fighter.
    The button only enumerates
    fighters currently launched into
    space.  You may need to launch
    your fighters from a carrier before
    you can gain control of them.

Q:  I have a real hard time dog fighting
    with the mouse and my Joystick
    doesn’t seem to respond.
A:  This game wasn't really designed
    as a Dog Fight oriented game so
    controls with the Joystick was
    left out.  (Okay we were too lazy
    to put in Joystick control.)

    However, you can still effectively
    dog fight with the mouse.  Select
    a target, then Use the Track 
    command ('R' Key board) to command
    your fighter to follow the target
    fighter. DON'T MOVE THE MOUSE until
    you are satisfied with your position
    behind the target. When your ready
    to shoot Move the mouse (Taking you
    out of Auto Track Mode) to Manually
    fly the fighter, point and shoot.
    Use the Up and Down arrow to adjust
    your fighter speed to match that
    of the target fighter so your 
    window to shoot is better.
