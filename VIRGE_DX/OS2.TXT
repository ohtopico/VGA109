        Installation Guide for OS/2 Video Device Driver
                   for the S3 ViRGE
                 Driver Version 1.00.12

1.0  Compatibility
 
  This graphics-accelerator device driver is compatible with OS/2
  2.11, and OS/2 Warp 3.0.

2.0  Preliminary Steps
 
  The following steps must be performed before you install the
  S3 ViRGE graphics-accelerator device driver:

  1. Prepare a blank 1.44M disette, copy all files under the 
     
     \S3virge\OS2 
     
     directory on this CD-ROM. Label the diskette the name 'S3 DRV1", then
     you have prepared the installation diskette.

  2. "S3 DRV1" must be the label on the installation diskette. This label 
     can be applied using the DOS or OS/2 LABEL command. The installation
     will fail without this step.

  3.  You must have OS/2 DOS Support installed.
  
  4.  If you previously installed SVGA support, you must reset the
      resolution to VGA mode, using the procedures in "Setting Your
      Display to VGA Mode" (section 5.0 in this README).

  5.  After driver installation, the OS/2 SYSLEVEL command may be used to
      confirm the new driver version level.  It may also be used prior to
      installation to verify the current driver version, however, some
      previous device drivers did not provide this information.  Following
      execution of the SYSLEVEL command look for the following information:

      C:\OS2\INSTALLATION\SYSLEVEL.VID
                    ViRGE
      Version 2.81     Component ID 562107701
      Current CSD level: S328103
      Prior   CSD level: S328018

      In this case the current version level is S3 2.81.03.
  6.  In some situations, installing this driver over 2.80.xx and 2.81.xx
      versions of the driver can result in duplicated icons.  To prevent
      this problem, you should delete the "S3 Windows Font Size" and
      "DDC Display Setup" icons from the System Setup Folder prior to
      installing this driver.


  7.  Read the Readme.txt file on the installation diskette before beginning
      the device driver installation.

3.0  Setting Your Display to VGA Mode

  Use the following procedures to reset to VGA mode.

  NOTE: If your display is out of sync, start OS/2 using the OS/2
    Installation Diskette.  Insert Diskette 1 when prompted, press
    F3 to display a command prompt, and then use the following
    instructions to reset your display mode.

  o   If you are installing this driver on OS/2 2.11 or OS/2 for
      Windows, and you installed from diskettes, do the following:

      1.  Under OS/2 2.1/2.11, before running RSPDSPI, delete the following
      file:

       [OS2 DRIVE]:\OS2\INSTALL\00S3.DSC

      3.  Be sure RSPDSPI.EXE is in the \OS2\INSTALL directory.  If it
      is, go to step 3.  If it is not, insert Diskette 8 into
      drive A and unpack RSPDSPI.EXE with the following command:

        C:\OS2\UNPACK A:\INSTAID C: /N:RSPDSPI.EXE

      where A: is the drive containing Diskette 8, and C: is the
      drive where OS/2 is installed.

      4.  Type C: and then press Enter.

      5.  Type CD C:\OS2\INSTALL and then press Enter.

      6.  Type the following:

        RSPDSPI /PK:VGA /SK:NONE /S:A:\ /T:C:

      In /T:C:, C: is the target drive where OS/2 is installed.  In /S:A:,
      A: is the source diskette drive for installing the device driver.

      Then press Enter.

      7.  Perform a shutdown and restart your computer.

  o   If you are installing this driver on OS/2 2.11 or OS/2 for
      Windows, and you installed from CD-ROM or a LAN, do the
      following:

      1.  Under OS/2 2.1/2.11, before running RSPDSPI, delete the following file:

        [OS2 DRIVE]:\OS2\INSTALL\00S3.DSC

      3.  Be sure RSPDSPI.EXE is in the \OS2\INSTALL directory.  If it
      is, go to step 3.  If it is not, unpack RSPDSPI.EXE with the
      following command:

         C:\OS2\UNPACK E:\DISK_8\INSTAID C: /N:RSPDSPI.EXE

      where C: is the drive where OS/2 is installed, and E: is
      the CD-ROM or LAN drive.

      4.  Type C: and then press Enter.

      5.  Type CD C:\OS2\INSTALL and then press Enter.

      6.  Type the following:

        RSPDSPI /PK:VGA /SK:NONE /S:E:\OS2SE21\ /T:C:

      In /T:C:, C: is the target drive where OS/2 is installed.  In /S:E:,
      E: is the source CD-ROM or LAN drive.

      Then press Enter.

      7.  Perform a shutdown and restart your computer.


4.0  Installing from Diskette

  To install the ViRGE device driver from diskette, do the
  following:

  1.  If system is not in VGA mode, select VGA mode.

  2.  Insert the ViRGE diskette into drive A (or any other
      diskette drive).

      Note: "S3 DRV1" must be the volume label of this diskette.
      To verify the label, use "Label A:".

  3.  Open an OS/2 full-screen or OS/2 window session.

  4.  At the OS/2 command prompt, type the following command to copy
      all necessary files to the OS/2 drive:

    A:SETUP

      where A: is the diskette drive.

      Then press Enter.

      Setup will then identify your chipset.  When prompted to do so, press
      Enter to continue.

  5.  When prompted to do so, select OK to perform a shutdown, and then
      restart your computer.  Make sure the diskette has been removed from
      the install drive.

  6.  Open the OS/2 System folder.

  7.  Open the System Setup folder.

  8.  Open the Display Driver Install object or enter "dspinstl" at
      an OS/2 command prompt.  When the Display Driver Install window
      appears, select Primary Display Driver and then select OK.

  9.  When the "Primary Display Driver List" window appears, select "S3
      ViRGE [32Bit] Version 1.00.12" to install the video
      driver.

  10. When the Monitor Configuration/Selection Utility window appears,
      the "Install Using Defaults for Monitor Type" choice is
      preselected.  You can accept this choice or select "Install
      Using Display Adapter Utility Program" to choose a different
      refresh rate.  Then select OK.

      If you select the "Install Using Display Adapter Utility
      Program" choice, you must have the DOS monitor utility program
      that came with your display adapter.  Contact the display
      adapter manufacturer's technical support for information on how
      to use the monitor utility program under OS/2.

      NOTE:  DSPINSTL determines the hardware configuration by
         creating the \OS2\SVGADATA.PMI file.  If the
         \OS2\SVGADATA.PMI file has not been created, the adapter
         will not be supported.  This process can take several
         seconds and will black-out the screen.

  11. When the Source Directory pop-up window appears, insert S3
      ViRGE diskette into drive A.  Then select Install.

  12. When the installation is complete, shut down your system, remove
      the diskette, and restart your computer.

  13. When the system has restarted:
      a.  Open the OS/2 System folder.
      b.  Open the System Setup folder.
      c.  Open the System object.
      d.  When the Settings notebook appears, select the Screen tab.
      If your monitor has been detected as Plug and-Play (DDC)
      compatible, go to step 15.

  14. On Screen page 2, select your display from the display list. If
      your display does not appear in the list, select Default.

      It might be necessary to restart your computer to have all
      refresh rate options available.

  15. When the system has restarted:
      a. Open the System object and select Screen page 1, as in step
     13.
      b. Select a screen resolution and a screen refresh rate.
      c. Close the Settings notebook.
      d. Perform a shutdown and restart your computer.

  NOTES:

   o During the installation of this driver, DISPLAY.LOG and
     DSPINSTL.LOG files are created in the OS/2\INSTALL directory.
     These files identify the OS/2 system files that were updated and
     indicate whether the installation was successful.  The contents
     of these files might be useful if you need to report an
     installation problem to IBM.

   o If the video memory size is changed after the device driver is
     installed, the device driver must be reinstalled in order for
     the system to recognize the change.  Not reinstalling the driver
     might result in serious system problems.

   o When starting a WIN-OS/2 session it is recommended that the user launch
     the session via one of the WIN-OS/2 icons located in the "Command
     Prompts" folder within the "OS/2 System" icon.  For additional information
     see section 10.0 Limitations.
