		OS/2 Video Device Driver for the 
	 S3 Vision864/964/868/968/Trio32/64/64V+/64V2
		    Driver Version 3.03.01

1.0  Compatibility
 
  This graphics-accelerator device driver is compatible with OS/2
  2.11, and OS/2 Warp 3.0.

2.0  Preliminary Steps

  The following steps must be performed before you install the
  Vision864/964/868/968/Trio32/64/64V+/64V2 graphics-accelerator device driver:

  1.  You must have OS/2 DOS Support installed.
  2.  If you previously installed SVGA support, you must reset the
      resolution to VGA mode, using the procedures in "Setting Your
      Display to VGA Mode".
  3.  After driver installation, the OS/2 SYSLEVEL command may be used to
      confirm the new driver version level.  It may also be used prior to
      installation to verify the current driver version, however, some
      previous device drivers did not provide this information.  Following
      execution of the SYSLEVEL command look for the following information:

      C:\OS2\INSTALLATION\SYSLEVEL.VID
					Vision864/964/868/968/Trio32/64/64V+/64V2
      Version 2.81     Component ID 562107701
      Current CSD level: S328103
      Prior   CSD level: S328018

      In this case the current version level is S3 2.81.03.
  4.  In some situations, installing this driver over 2.80.xx and 2.81.xx
      versions of the driver can result in duplicated icons.  To prevent
      this problem, you should delete the "S3 Windows Font Size" and
      "DDC Display Setup" icons from the System Setup Folder prior to
      installing this driver.



3.0  Setting Your Display to VGA Mode

  Use the following procedures to reset to VGA mode.

  NOTE: If your display is out of sync, start OS/2 using the OS/2
        Installation Diskette.  Insert Diskette 1 when prompted, press
        F3 to display a command prompt, and then use the following
        instructions to reset your display mode.

  o   If you are installing this driver on OS/2 Warp, do the
      following:

      1.  Turn on your computer.  If your computer is already on,
          press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart it.
      2.  When a small white box appears in the upper left-hand corner
          of your screen, press Alt+F1.
      3.  When the Recovery Choices screen appears, press V.

      Your display adapter is restored and can work in VGA mode.  If
      you want to install a new display adapter or video device
      driver, refer to Chapter 16, "Video Procedures," in the User's
      Guide to OS/2 Warp.


4.0  Installing from CD-ROM

  To install the Vision864/964/868/968/Trio32/64/64V+/64V2 device driver
  from CD-ROM, do the following:

  1.  If system is not in VGA mode, select VGA mode.

  2.  Insert the CD-ROM into CD-ROM drive. 

  3.  Open an OS/2 full-screen or OS/2 window session.

  4.  At the OS/2 command prompt, type the following command to copy
      all necessary files to the OS/2 drive:

        D:\S3trioV\OS2\SETUP

      (Assume CD-ROM is on drive D, if it is not, use the correct 
       drive letter instead)

      Then press Enter.

      Setup will then identify your chipset.  When prompted to do so, press
      Enter to continue.

  5.  When prompted to do so, select OK to perform a shutdown, and then
      restart your computer.  Make sure the diskette has been removed from
      the install drive.

  6.  Open the OS/2 System folder.

  7.  Open the System Setup folder.

  8.  Open the Display Driver Install object or enter "dspinstl" at
      an OS/2 command prompt.  When the Display Driver Install window
      appears, select Primary Display Driver and then select OK.

  9.  When the "Primary Display Driver List" window appears, select "S3
      Vision864/964/868/968/Trio32/64/64V+/64V2 [32Bit] Version 3.03.01" to install the video
      driver.

  10. When the Monitor Configuration/Selection Utility window appears,
      the "Install Using Defaults for Monitor Type" choice is
      preselected.  You can accept this choice or select "Install
      Using Display Adapter Utility Program" to choose a different
      refresh rate.  Then select OK.

      If you select the "Install Using Display Adapter Utility
      Program" choice, you must have the DOS monitor utility program
      that came with your display adapter.  Contact the display
      adapter manufacturer's technical support for information on how
      to use the monitor utility program under OS/2.

      NOTE:  DSPINSTL determines the hardware configuration by
	     creating the \OS2\SVGADATA.PMI file.  If the
	     \OS2\SVGADATA.PMI file has not been created, the adapter
	     will not be supported.  This process can take several
	     seconds and will black-out the screen.

  11. When the Source Directory pop-up window appears, insert the CD into
      CD-ROM(assume the CD-ROM is at drive D:), input the source directory 
      as
            D:\S3TRIOV\OS2
      
      Then select Install.

  12. When the installation is complete, shut down your system, remove
      the diskette, and restart your computer.

  13. When the system has restarted:
      a.  Open the OS/2 System folder.
      b.  Open the System Setup folder.
      c.  Open the System object.
      d.  When the Settings notebook appears, select the Screen tab.
	  If your monitor has been detected as Plug and-Play (DDC)
	  compatible, go to step 15.

  14. On Screen page 2, select your display from the display list. If
      your display does not appear in the list, select Default.

      It might be necessary to restart your computer to have all
      refresh rate options available.

  15. When the system has restarted:
      a. Open the System object and select Screen page 1, as in step
	 13.
      b. Select a screen resolution and a screen refresh rate.
      c. Close the Settings notebook.
      d. Perform a shutdown and restart your computer.

  NOTES:

   o During the installation of this driver, DISPLAY.LOG and
     DSPINSTL.LOG files are created in the OS/2\INSTALL directory.
     These files identify the OS/2 system files that were updated and
     indicate whether the installation was successful.	The contents
     of these files might be useful if you need to report an
     installation problem to IBM.

   o If the video memory size is changed after the device driver is
     installed, the device driver must be reinstalled in order for
     the system to recognize the change.  Not reinstalling the driver
     might result in serious system problems.

   o When starting a WIN-OS/2 session it is recommended that the user launch
     the session via one of the WIN-OS/2 icons located in the "Command
     Prompts" folder within the "OS/2 System" icon.  For additional information
     see section 10.0 Limitations.
