BEGINFIRSTSCREEN

  You have chosen to install S3 VGA Dos Utilities.  
  The S3 VGA Dos Utilities include the following programs:

  1. S3REFRSH.EXE 
       Run this program to configure the display adapter for the highest 
       vertical refresh rates supported by your monitor. Higher refresh 
       rate is less likely to cause eye fatigue due to screen flicker. 
       The configuration settings you select can optionally be written to 
       your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that the display adapter will be set 
       according to your selections each time you start the system.

  2. S3MODE.EXE
       Run this program whenever you need to configure the S3 for a 
       specific video mode.  

  3. FCON.EXE
       Run this program whenever you need to configure the S3 Feature 
       Connector feature.
