(I) S3 DOS Utilities

  1. S3REFRSH.EXE 
       Run this program to configure the display adapter for  
       the highest vertical refresh rates supported by your
       monitor. Higher refresh rate is less likely to cause
       eye fatigue due to screen flicker. The configuration
       settings you select can optionally be written to your
       AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that the display adapter will be
       set according to your selections each time you start
       the system.

  2. SMODE.EXE
       Run this program whenever you need to configure the S3  
       for a specific video mode.

  AutoCAD 12 for DOS, AutoCAD 13 for DOS, and 3D Studio 4.0 for DOS.
