  You have chosen to install 
  
  TurboDLD-Classic for AutoCAD Release 12/13. 
  
  We recommend installing into the DRV sub-directory of 
  your main AutoCAD directory. 

  You may also install TurboDLD-Classic into its own sub-
  directory, to do so enter an alternate sub-directory name.
  If you install TurboDLD-Classic into its own sub-directory,  
  you will have to alter your ACADDRV enviroment variable to
  include the TurboDLD-Classic sub-directory.
