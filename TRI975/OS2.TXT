        Installation Guide for OS/2 Video Device Driver


Installing from CD-ROM
======================

  To install the OS2E device driver from CD-ROM, do the following:

  1.  If system is not in VGA mode, select VGA mode.

  2.  Insert the CD-ROM into CD-ROM drive. 

  3.  Open an OS/2 full-screen or OS/2 window session.

  4.  At the OS/2 command prompt, type the following command to copy
      all necessary files to the OS/2 drive:

        D:\TRI975\OS2\SETUP

      (Assume CD-ROM is on drive D, if it is not, use the correct 
       drive letter instead)

      Then press Enter.

      Setup will then identify your chipset.  When prompted to do so, press
      Enter to continue.


  5. When the Monitor Configuration/Selection Utility window appears,
      the "Install Using Defaults for Monitor Type" choice is
      preselected.  You can accept this choice or select "Install
      Using Display Adapter Utility Program" to choose a different
      refresh rate.  Then select OK.

      If you select the "Install Using Display Adapter Utility
      Program" choice, you must have the DOS monitor utility program
      that came with your display adapter.  Contact the display
      adapter manufacturer's technical support for information on how
      to use the monitor utility program under OS/2.


  6. When the installation is complete, shut down your system, and 
      restart your computer.

  7. When the system has restarted:
      a.  Open the OS/2 System folder.
      b.  Open the System Setup folder.
      c.  Open the System object.
      d.  When the Settings notebook appears, select the Screen tab.
      e.  Select a screen resolution and a screen refresh rate.
      f.  Close the Settings notebook.
      g.  Perform a shutdown and restart your computer.
